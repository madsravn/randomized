\subsection*{Randomized fingerprinting of multisets}
\subsubsection*{Introduction}
In the following report we will describe the results from implementing a fingerprinting algorithm for determining multiset equality based upon $2$-$Universal$ hash functions and \emph{Schwartz-Zippel}.
The issue of determining multiset equality with a deterministic approach is that there are no obvious way that is better than using an efficient sorting algorithm and test for equality. Using the \emph{Schwartz-Zippel} approach also allows us to trivially extend the algorithm to a \emph{streaming} implementation, working efficiently on large datasets. No such approach seems to be possible for the deterministic approach.

\subsection*{Equality of hashed multisets}
\begin{definition}{2-Universal hash functions}\\
A hash function h(x) from some Universe \emph{U} to a table {T}, where $|U| >> |T|$, is 2\emph{-}universal iff $x \neq y, x,y \in U \Rightarrow Pr[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{|T|}$
\end{definition}
In the rest of the report $T$ will be $\mathbb{F}_p$ where $p = 2^{31} - 1$, which is prime.
We now consider two distinct multisets $X = \left[x_1,\cdots, x_n\right]$ and $Y = \left[y_1, \cdots, y_n\right]$. We note that we can assume that both sets have the same size, as it is trivial to determine inequality, if the multisets have the different sizes.
We wish to show that given a hash function $x$ selected uniformly randomly from the family of 2-universal hash functions $H$, $h(X) = \left[h(x_1),\cdots, h(x_n)\right]$ is equal to $h(Y) = \left[h(y_1),\cdots,h(y_n)\right]$ with at most probability $\frac{n}{p}$.
